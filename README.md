# SpeechOscilloscope
Voice controlled oscilloscope
Useful when your hands are full of probes and you need to pause to look at a signal.

Run "sudo python3 SpeechRec.py" to start.

Say "Oscilloscope Stop" to pause a sample.

Say "Oscilloscope Run" to unpause sampling and continue viewing.

Using Google's Speecch Recognition through the python Speech Recognition API package, and the USBTMC oscilloscope driver created by sbrinkmann
